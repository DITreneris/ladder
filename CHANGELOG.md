### Security

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-31

v1 launch hardening — env ergonomics, tests, Telegram theme, deploy tooling.

### Added
- **Unified env loading:** repo root `.env` read by API, bot, and mini-app (Vite `envDir`); `scripts/setup-env.ps1` / `setup-env.sh` for optional sync
- **API integration tests:** `/auth/me`, `/runs` (valid, invalid hash, rung mismatch, rate limit, invalid rank), weekly leaderboard; expired `auth_date` unit test
- **Deploy scripts:** `scripts/verify-deploy-config.*`, `scripts/smoke-local.*` for preflight and local smoke
- **Telegram theme:** `themeParams` → `--cl-*` CSS variables; shell/header adapt to light/dark mode
- **Mini-app README:** play instructions, folder map, env vars, commands
- **Vitest:** rank thresholds, engine collision/coffee/stop tests; CI runs `npm test`

### Fixed
- Offline high score now persists to `localStorage` when not in Telegram
- Burnout game-over copy typo ("Collant" → "Cognitive overload")
- Bot handle in header uses `VITE_BOT_USERNAME` instead of hardcoded `@CorporateLadderBot`
- Telegram username input is read-only when opened inside Telegram
- `final_rank` validated as `Intern` | `Manager` | `CEO` on score submit

### Changed
- Documented in-memory rate limit caveat for multi-replica Railway in `docs/architecture.md`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

Initial monorepo scaffold — MVP v1 foundation.

### Added
- **Monorepo layout:** `apps/mini-app`, `apps/bot`, `packages/api`, `supabase/`
- **Mini App (TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind):** game engine ported from prototype — tap left/right, 3 obstacles, coffee recovery, burnout meter, 3 ranks (Intern → Manager → CEO)
- **Telegram integration:** WebApp SDK wrapper, initData auth, share with clipboard fallback
- **FastAPI backend:** `POST /auth/me`, `POST /runs`, `GET /leaderboard?period=daily|weekly`, Telegram HMAC validation, score sanity checks
- **Telegram bot (aiogram):** `/start` with Mini App launch button
- **Supabase schema:** `users`, `game_runs` tables with RLS (public read, service-role writes)
- **Docs:** `docs/mvp-scope.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Cursor config:** 6 rules, 3 project skills (telegram auth, score pipeline, deploy)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions — API pytest, bot import smoke test, mini-app lint + build
- **Deploy configs:** Railway Dockerfiles for API and bot, Vercel config for mini-app

### Changed
- Leaderboard UI: Daily + Weekly tabs only (Legends/All-time deferred to v1.1)
- Score persistence: localStorage prototype replaced with API + Supabase path (localStorage fallback when outside Telegram)

### Security
- Bot token and Supabase service role key restricted to Railway API; never exposed in frontend
